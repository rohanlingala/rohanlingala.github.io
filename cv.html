               <p> My resume consists of a variety of different hardware and software projects.
                The types of projects I primarily enjoy are ones where I have to both use
                Hardware and software, or utilize clever and novel thinking to solve problems.
                For example, with the Oscilloscope project, I had to create a new and novel way
                to analyze waveform shape because our Raspberry Pi 4b had trouble notating raw
                analog values, instead only giving high and low values. Using the ratio of high to low values
                over a period that was algorithmically determined, we were able to detect waveform shapes
                given certain frequency and voltage tolerances. This kind of unique thinking is something I would
                like to bring to the table in terms of creative and clever problem solving.
                <br> <br>
                I am able to code in C/C++, Python, as well as front-end web development, I am also comfortable working in class based and low level memory mapping programming as well. My technical areas of interest include cybersecurity, information technology, machine learning, and anything regarding Python as I am the most comfortable with it as a language. Since I also take electrical engineering courses, I have a robust knowledge of computer hardware and electronics. For example, with the Future Drum Machine project I had to help implement a 16:5 Multiplexor that would read into GPIO pins from a Raspberry Pi in order to run Python code to drive the system. As one of the few computer engineering students on our team it was my job to make sure the electronics worked with the software systems correctly and I was to debug the systems if necessary as well.
                <br> <br>
                I also bring a good amount of soft skills to the table, I am able to be a team player or a leader if needed, 
                in many different projects I have shifted from a worker bee to a more managerial role and am able to understand 
                the nuance and dichotomy of working in tandem with others. Feel free to email me about anything if 
                you are interested in looking at the code!
