            I have done a lot of community service over the years msot of which was done during middle school and high school. When I was younger I would volunteer in the Telegu Christian Fellowship church group where I would set up and tear down the venue as well as serve food and participate in events. I have been volunteering with them since I was about 9 since my dad was heavily involved in their leadership, however later in high school and now in college I do not have as much time to volunteer for them.
            My volunteering history for Sugar Creek Baptist Church is also quite similar, I volunteered to do audio/visual work when they built a new church campus closer to my neighborhood. I handled lighting, and presentation slides, when I got a bit older they also gave me training to work on the mix board. That experience working on a mix board inadvertently help jump start my audio engineering career as I realized I loved working with mix boards and with signal processing. I volunteered most every Sunday morning from middle school to high school and had trainings on Saturdays.
            In high school I was in the Engineering Academy where we had to meet semester deadlines for volunteer work, by the end of my senior year I had over 100 logged hours, most of which were at Second Mile Food Bank where I would organize their warehouse and help give out food.
