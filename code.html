            <p> I have worked on many different 
                code projects over the last few semesters, here are a my few of my favorites! 
                A project I am particularly proud of is my hackintosh project 
                which I built with the help of <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html">Opencore</a>
                and <a href ="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Precision-7520-Spec-Sheet.pdf "> Dell specification sheets.</a>
                My most recent project was an audio sampler driven by a Raspberry Pi utilizing Python code for programming logic, and HTML/CSS for creating a user interface.
                <br> <br>
                This project was completed over the course of around 8 weeks and required intensive planning, scheduling, and ingenuity. 
                There were many different ways we creatively solved our problems in hardware and software. Our software work was based on
                <a href="https://aubio.org/manual/latest/ "> aubio's </a> work primarily, with extra inspiration from 
                <a href="https://rubberbandaudio.com/"> rubber band audio's </a> code base.
                Using this <a href="https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c"> pinout diagram </a> we were able to map our 
                custom hardware configuration to the proper GPIO pins labeled in the software.
                If you are interested in how I contributed to this project or have any questions feel free to send me an email. Linked here is my
