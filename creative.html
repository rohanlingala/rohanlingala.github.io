            I do a lot of music and creative projects in my free time! c:
            <br>
            <br> I have been doing audio engineering and music production work since 2020,
             I had many mentors and friends help me learn over the years, but I grew particularly fond of the <a href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/"> pro audio files forums.</a>
            <br>
            <br> Since then, I have worked with many artists in the local Houston music scene, and have spent a lot of time in studio and even doing shows!
            <br>
            <br> Mostly I do recording work and focus on school for now, but I always try to make
            <br> time to produce or write for new projects.
            <br>
            <br> Currently, I'm working on a film project, a few projects with dancers, and doing audio gigs around Houston. Linked here are some videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzlCLIUDVmfSjdLwMi13mOQ"> PHILSA Modern, </a>
            a dance group I've done lots of work with.
