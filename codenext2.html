            <p> Machine learning is a big topic of interest of mine! 
                Over the Fall 2022 semester I took a class where I learned 
                about machine learning in the lens of cybersecurity, and was 
                able to properly implement machine learning based solutions.

                For a project, we had to write an IEEE style research paper, 
                and our topic was using Random Forest classifiers to categorize headlines.
                Embedded below is our project we worked on! 
                Feel free to email if you have any questions.
